Pizza is one of the most popular foods in the world, consisting of a round, flat base of dough topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings, such as vegetables, meats, and herbs. The pizza is baked in an oven until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted. Originally from Italy, pizza has become a global favorite with countless regional and cultural variations.

Pizza can be made with various types of crusts, including thin, thick, stuffed, and gluten-free options. Common toppings include pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers, but pizza can also be customized with endless ingredient combinations.
Pizza's origins date back to Naples, Italy, in the 18th century. Neapolitan pizza is still one of the most famous varieties, characterized by a soft, thin crust and simple toppings such as tomatoes, mozzarella, and fresh basil. In the United States, pizza has evolved into different styles, including New York-style pizza with a thin, foldable crust, and Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, which features a thick, buttery crust and layers of cheese and toppings.
1. Introduction to Pizza
Pizza is a popular dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients, including anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, etc., which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. It is often served with additional garnishes like basil, oregano, and garlic.
2. History of Pizza
The history of pizza dates back to antiquity. Early forms of pizza can be traced back to the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. The Greeks, for instance, used to bake a flatbread with herbs, oil, and cheese. However, the modern pizza as we know it today has its origins in Naples, Italy, during the 18th or early 19th century. The name pizza was first documented in AD 997 in Gaeta, Italy, and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy.
3. Birth of Modern Pizza
Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries. In 1889, Raffaele Esposito, a Neapolitan pizzaiolo, created the "Pizza Margherita" in honor of the Queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy. The pizza, featuring tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, was meant to represent the national colors of Italy: red, white, and green. This event is often pointed to as the birth of the modern pizza.
4. Ingredients in Pizza
The essential components of pizza are the crust, the sauce, and the toppings.
Crust: Pizza crusts can be thin and crispy, like in traditional Neapolitan pizza, or thick and chewy, like in American-style pizzas. The dough is usually made from wheat flour, yeast, water, and salt. Some variations use whole wheat or gluten-free flours.
Sauce: The most common pizza sauce is made from tomatoes, often seasoned with herbs like oregano, basil, and garlic. However, white pizzas may use an Alfredo or béchamel sauce, while others might use pesto or barbecue sauce.
Cheese: Mozzarella is the most popular cheese for pizza, known for its meltability and mild flavor. However, other cheeses like provolone, Parmesan, cheddar, and even blue cheese can be used.
Toppings: Traditional toppings range from meats like pepperoni, sausage, and ham to vegetables like bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and olives. There are endless possibilities for creative toppings like anchovies, pineapple, arugula, prosciutto, and even truffles.
5. Types of Pizza
Neapolitan Pizza: Known for its thin crust and simple ingredients, a traditional Neapolitan pizza is made with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil. It is cooked in a wood-fired oven and has a soft, airy crust.
New York-Style Pizza: This style is characterized by large, thin, and flexible slices. It has a thicker crust than Neapolitan but is still thin enough to fold in half. It's typically sold by the slice and topped with simple ingredients like cheese, tomato sauce, and pepperoni.
Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza: Originating from Chicago, this pizza has a thick crust that forms a bowl for copious amounts of cheese and tomato sauce, with toppings like sausage or vegetables layered in. The crust is typically buttery and crisp, and the pizza is baked in a deep pan.
Sicilian Pizza: Sicilian pizza is known for its thick, square slices with a crispy bottom and a soft interior. It's often topped with tomato sauce, anchovies, onions, and herbs. The cheese is sometimes placed underneath the sauce to prevent it from becoming soggy.
Detroit-Style Pizza: A deep-dish, rectangular pizza with a thick, chewy crust and caramelized cheese edges. The sauce is usually layered on top of the cheese and toppings, rather than underneath.
Calzone: Although not strictly a pizza, a calzone is a folded pizza dough filled with cheese, meats, and vegetables. It’s essentially a pizza pocket that is baked to golden perfection.
Margherita Pizza: As mentioned earlier, this pizza is named after Queen Margherita of Savoy and is the essence of simplicity. It consists of tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, salt, and olive oil.
Hawaiian Pizza: This controversial pizza is topped with pineapple and ham, creating a sweet-and-savory contrast that people either love or hate.
White Pizza (Pizza Bianca): This type of pizza is made without tomato sauce, using a white sauce like béchamel or ricotta, sometimes topped with garlic, olive oil, and cheese.
Greek Pizza: Typically found in Greek-American restaurants, this pizza has a thicker, puffier crust and is often topped with a variety of Mediterranean ingredients, such as feta cheese, olives, red onions, and spinach.
6. Pizza in Different Cultures
Pizza has crossed borders and become a global phenomenon. Here's how it’s viewed and consumed in different parts of the world:
United States: In the U.S., pizza has evolved into many regional styles, including New York-style, Chicago deep-dish, and California gourmet pizzas, often topped with exotic ingredients like avocados or goat cheese.
Italy: In its home country, pizza is seen as an artisanal food. In Naples, traditional pizzas are made following strict regulations governing the ingredients and preparation methods to be considered "authentic."
Japan: In Japan, pizza has taken on a unique twist with toppings like squid, mayonnaise, and eel. Popular pizza chains also offer pizzas with mochi (a chewy rice cake) or teriyaki sauce.
Brazil: Brazilian pizzas are often topped with unique ingredients like catupiry (a creamy cheese), corn, hearts of palm, and quail eggs. Sweet pizzas topped with chocolate and fruit are also popular.
India: Pizza in India is typically more spicy, with toppings such as paneer, tandoori chicken, and spicy sauces to cater to Indian tastes.
7. Making Pizza at Home
Making pizza at home has become increasingly popular, especially with the rise of pizza stones and wood-fired pizza ovens for home use. Here are some steps to make an excellent homemade pizza:
1. Preparing the Dough:
Mix flour, yeast, water, and salt to form a dough.
Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it's smooth and elastic.
Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it has doubled in size.
2. Shaping the Dough:
After the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into portions.
Roll or stretch the dough into your desired shape and thickness, being careful not to overwork it.
3. Adding Toppings:
Spread a thin layer of sauce over the base.
Add cheese and toppings evenly, being careful not to overload the pizza, as too many toppings can cause it to become soggy.
4. Baking:
Preheat your oven to a high temperature, ideally 500°F (260°C). If you're using a pizza stone, let it preheat in the oven as well.
Bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling.
For a wood-fired pizza oven, baking time is reduced to just a few minutes due to the higher temperature.
Tips for Success:
Use a pizza stone to get a crispy crust.
Don't overload the pizza with too many toppings.
If using vegetables like mushrooms or spinach, cook them first to avoid excess moisture.
8. Nutritional Aspects of Pizza
Pizza can be both a healthy and unhealthy meal, depending on the ingredients used and portion size.
Calories: A typical slice of pizza contains between 200 to 300 calories, with variations depending on the thickness of the crust, the amount of cheese, and the type of toppings. Deep-dish and stuffed pizzas, for example, tend to be much higher in calories than thin-crust pizzas.
Fats and Sodium: Pizza can be high in fats, especially saturated fats from cheese and meat toppings. Many commercial pizzas also contain significant amounts of sodium due to the use of cured meats like pepperoni or sausage and salted cheeses.
Fiber and Nutrients: If you make pizza with whole wheat crust and top it with plenty of vegetables, you can boost its fiber and nutrient content. Adding leafy greens, mushrooms, and bell peppers increases the vitamins and minerals, making pizza a more balanced meal.
Healthier Pizza Options:
Opt for a thin crust or whole wheat crust to reduce calories and add fiber.
Choose leaner meats like chicken or turkey sausage, or go for vegetarian options.
Reduce the amount of cheese or use a lower-fat cheese.
Load up on vegetables like spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, and peppers.
9. Pizza in Popular Culture
Pizza is not just food; it’s a cultural icon. It has appeared in countless movies, TV shows, and even video games. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, for instance, are famously known for their love of pizza. Pizza also plays a central role in many social gatherings, including parties, game nights, and office lunches.
In the U.S., National Pizza Day is celebrated annually on February 9th, where people celebrate by eating and sharing their favorite pizzas.
10. Conclusion
Pizza is a beloved dish that transcends cultures, bringing people together with its warm, comforting flavors and endless topping possibilities. Whether it's the classic Margherita, a loaded deep-dish, or a fusion creation with local flavors, pizza's versatility has cemented its place as one of the most popular and iconic foods in the world.
Pizza
Pizza[a][1]is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[2]
The term pizza was first recorded in the year 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[3] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.[4][5][6][7]In 2009, Neapolitan pizza[8] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In 2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was added to UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[9]
Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[10]In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[11][12]In casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self assembly. They are then cooked using a home oven.
In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion,

and in the U.S. it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[13] Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged two years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[14]
Etymology
The oldest recorded usage of the word pizza is from a Latin text from the town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze (lit. 'twelve pizzas') every Christmas Day, and another twelve every Easter Sunday.[3][15]
Suggested etymologies include:
Byzantine Greek and Late Latin pitta > pizza, cf. Modern Greek pitta bread and the Apulia and Calabrian (then Byzantine Italy) pitta,[16] a round flat bread baked in the oven at high temperature sometimes with toppings. The word pitta can in turn be traced to either Ancient Greek πικτή (pikte), 'fermented pastry', which in Latin became picta, or Ancient Greek πίσσα (pissa, Attic: πίττα, pitta), 'pitch',[17][18] or πήτεα (pḗtea), 'bran' (πητίτης, pētítēs, 'bran bread').[19]
The Etymological Dictionary of the Italian Language explains it as coming from dialectal pinza, 'clamp', as in modern Italian pinze, 'pliers, pincers, tongs, forceps'. Their origin is from Latin pinsere, 'to pound, stamp'.[20]
The Lombardic word bizzo or pizzo, meaning 'mouthful' (related to the English words bit and bite), which was brought to Italy in the middle of the 6th century AD by the invading Lombards.[3][21] The shift b>p could be explained by the High German consonant shift, and it has been noted in this connection that in German the word Imbiss means 'snack'.
A small pizza is sometimes called pizzetta.[22] A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.[23]
The word pizza was borrowed from Italian into English in the 1930s; before it became well known, pizza was called "tomato pie" by English speakers. Some regional pizza variations still use the name tomato pie.[24]
History
Records of pizza-like foods can be found throughout ancient
history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of the
Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked
flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle
shields[25][26] and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread
with oils, herbs, and cheese.[27][28] An early reference to a pizza
like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the
Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they
are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII,
Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes
(such as pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat
the bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by
Celaeno.[29]In 2023, archeologists discovered a fresco in Pompeii
appearing to depict a pizza-like dish among other foodstuffs and
staples on a silver platter. Italy's culture minister said it "may be a
distant ancestor of the modern dish".[30][31] The first mention of
the word pizza comes from a notarial document written in Latin
and dating to May 997 AD from Gaeta, demanding a payment of "twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas Day, and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter Day".[32]
A pizzaiolo in 1830
Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.[33] Before that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims,[33] although it certainly
could not have been before the 16th century and the Columbian Exchange. Pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries until about 1830, when pizzerias in Naples started to have stanze with tables where clients could sit and eat their pizzas on the spot.[34]
A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita,[35] was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag—red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this type of pizza was then named after the queen,[36] with an official letter of recognition from the queen's "head of service" remaining to this day on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.[37] Later research cast doubt on this legend, undermining the authenticity of the letter of recognition, pointing that no media of the period reported about the supposed visit and that both the story and name Margherita were first promoted in the 1930s– 1940s.[38][39]
Pizza was taken to the United States by Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century[40] and first appeared in areas where they concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York City in 1905.[41]Italian Americans migrating from East to West brought with them their crusty, delicious dish. From there, the American version exported to the rest of the world.[42]
The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. 'True Neapolitan Pizza Association') is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.[43]In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish,[44][45] and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[9]
Preparation
Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough, and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.
In the U.S., another form of pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold unbaked to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to assemble at home before baking in an oven.

Baking
In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with fire bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or, in traditional style in a wood or coal-fired brick oven. The pizza is slid into the oven on a long paddle, called "peel", and baked directly on hot bricks, a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum), or whatever the oven surface is. Before use, a peel is typically sprinkled with cornmeal to allow the pizza to easily slide on and off it.[46] When made at home, a pizza can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce some of the heating effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly on a metal surface results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it.[47] Some home chefs use a wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. As in restaurants, these are often dome-shaped, as pizza ovens have been for centuries,[48]in order to achieve even heat distribution. Another variation is grilled pizza, in which the pizza is baked directly on a barbecue grill. Some types, such as Sicilian pizza, deep-dish Chicago-style pizza and Greek pizza, are baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.
Most restaurants use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables to assemble their pizzas. Mass production of pizza by chains can be completely automated.

Crust
The bottom of the pizza, called the "crust", may vary widely according to style—thin as in a typical hand tossed Neapolitan pizza or thick as in a deep-dish Chicago-style. It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the cornicione.[49] Some pizza dough contains sugar, to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.[50]
Dipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by American pizza chain Papa John's Pizza in 1984 and has since been adopted by some when eating pizza, especially the crust.[51]
Cheese
Mozzarella cheese is commonly used on pizza, with the buffalo mozzarella produced in the surroundings of Naples.[52] Other cheeses are also used, particularly burrata, Gorgonzola, provolone, pecorino romano, ricotta, and scamorza. Less expensive processed cheeses or cheese analogues have been developed for mass-market pizzas to produce desirable qualities such as browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and stable shelf life. This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins, and other changes in manufacture. In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was 1 million metric tons (1,100,000 short tons) in the U.S. and 100,000 metric tons (110,000 short tons) in Europe.[53]

By region of origin
Italy
Authentic Neapolitan pizza (Italian: pizza napoletana) is made
with San Marzano tomatoes, grown on the volcanic plains south of
Mount Vesuvius, and either mozzarella di bufala campana, made
with milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of
Campania and Lazio,[57] or fior di latte.[58] Buffalo mozzarella is
protected with its own European protected designation of origin
(PDO).[57] Other traditional pizzas include pizza marinara,
supposedly the most ancient tomato-topped pizza,[59] pizza
capricciosa, which is prepared with mozzarella cheese, baked ham, mushroom, artichoke, and tomato,[60] and pizza pugliese, prepared with tomato, mozzarella, and onions.[61]
Pizza Margherita
A popular variant of pizza in Italy is Sicilian pizza (locally called sfincione or sfinciuni),[62][63] a thick crust or deep-dish pizza originating during the 17th century in Sicily: it is essentially a focaccia that is typically topped with tomato sauce and other ingredients. Until the 1860s, sfincione was the type of pizza
usually consumed in Sicily, especially in the Western portion of the island.[64] Other variations of pizzas are also found in other regions of Italy, for example pizza al padellino or pizza al tegamino, a small-sized, thick-crust, deep-dish pizza typically served in Turin, Piedmont.[65][66][67]
United States
The first pizzeria in the U.S. was opened in New York City's Little
Italy in 1905.[68] Common toppings for pizza in the United States
include anchovies, ground beef, chicken, ham, mushrooms, olives,
onions, peppers, pepperoni, pineapple, salami, sausage, spinach,
steak, and tomatoes. Distinct regional types developed in the 20th
century, including Buffalo,[69] California, Chicago, Detroit, Greek,
New Haven, New York, and St. Louis styles.[70] These regional
variations include deep-dish, stuffed, pockets, turnovers, rolled, and pizza-on-a-stick, each with seemingly limitless combinations of sauce and toppings.

Thirteen percent of the United States population consumes pizza on any given day.[71] Pizza chains such as Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's, pizzas from take and bake pizzerias, and chilled or frozen pizzas from supermarkets make pizza readily available nationwide.
Argentina
Argentine pizza is a mainstay of the country's cuisine,[72]
especially of its capital Buenos Aires, where it is regarded as a
cultural heritage and icon of the city.[73][74][75] Argentina is the
country with the most pizzerias per inhabitant in the world and,
although they are consumed throughout the country, the highest
concentration of pizzerias and customers is Buenos Aires, the city
with the highest consumption of pizzas in the world (estimated in
2015 to be 14 million per year).[76] As such, the city has been considered as one of the world capitals of pizza.[74][76] The dish was introduced to Buenos Aires in the late 19th century with the massive Italian immigration, as part of a broader great European immigration wave to the country.[74] Thus, around the same time
Traditional Argentine-style pizzas de molde being prepared at a pizzeria in Buenos Aires
that the iconic pizza Margherita[77] was being invented in Italy, pizza were already being cooked in the Argentine capital.[78] The impoverished Italian immigrants that arrived to the city transformed the originally modest dish into a much more hefty meal, motivated by the abundance of food in Argentina.[76][79]In the 1930s, pizza was cemented as a cultural icon in Buenos Aires, with the new pizzerias becoming a central space for sociability for the working class people who flocked to the city.[79][78]
The most characteristic style of Argentine pizza—which almost all the classic pizzerias in Buenos Aires specialize in—is the so-called pizza de molde (Spanish for 'pizza in the pan'), characterized by having a "thick, spongy base and elevated bready crust".[74] This style, which today is identified as the typical style of Argentine pizza—characterized by a thick crust and a large amount of cheese—arose when impoverished Italian immigrants found a greater abundance of food in then-prosperous Argentina, which motivated them to transform the originally modest dish into a much more hefty meal suitable for a main
course.[76][79] The name pizza de molde emerged because there were no pizza ovens in the city, so bakers resorted to baking them in pans.[80] Since they used bakery plates, Argentine pizzas were initially square or rectangular, a format associated with the 1920s that is still maintained in some classic pizzerias, especially for vegetable pizzas, fugazzetas or fugazzas.[80]
Other styles of Argentine pizza include the iconic fugazza and its derivative fugazzeta or fugazza con queso (a terminology that varies depending on the pizzeria),[74] or the pizza de cancha or canchera (a cheese-less variant).[81] Most pizza menus include standard flavor combinations, including the traditional plain mozzarella, nicknamed "muza" or "musa"; the napolitana or "napo", with "cheese, sliced tomatoes, garlic, dried oregano and a few green olives", not to be confused with Neapolitan pizza;[74] calabresa, with slices of longaniza;[82]jamon y morrones, with sliced ham and roasted bell peppers;[74] as well as versions with provolone, with anchovies,[82] with hearts of palm, or with chopped hard boiled egg.[74] A typical custom that is unique to Buenos Aires is to accompany pizza with fainá, a pancake made from chickpea flour.[83]
Dessert pizza
The terms dessert pizza and sweet pizza are used for a variety of dishes resembling a pizza, including chocolate pizza and fruit pizza.[84][85] Some are based on a traditional yeast dough pizza base,[86] while others have a cookie-like base[87] and resemble a traditional pizza solely in having a flat round shape with a distinct base and topping. Some pizza restaurants offer dessert pizzas: as of May 2024 PizzaExpress offers a "White Chocolate & Salted Caramel Pizza Dolce",[88] and Franco Pepe at his Pepe In Grani offers desserts including "Gelsomina: Fried pizza slice with custard, mulberry syrup, butter, violet crystals, citrus zest and icing sugar".[89]
Nutrition
Some pizzas mass-produced by American pizza chains have been criticized as having an unhealthy balance of ingredients. Pizza can be high in salt and fat, and is high in calories. The USDA reports an average sodium content of 5,100 mg per 14 in (36 cm) pizza in fast food chains.[90][91][92]
Similar dishes
Calzone and stromboli are similar dishes that are often
made of pizza dough folded (calzone) or rolled
(stromboli) around a filling.
Coca is a similar dish consumed mainly in Catalonia and
neighboring regions, but that has extended to other
areas in Spain, and to Algeria. There are sweet and
