French fries are a universally loved food, enjoyed as a snack, side dish, or even a main course in various forms worldwide. Made primarily from potatoes, which are cut into thin strips, fried in oil, and typically seasoned with salt, French fries are known for their golden-brown crispy exterior and soft, fluffy interior. Though their origins are often disputed, with both Belgium and France claiming the invention, it is believed that French fries first appeared in Belgian villages, where locals initially fried fish and later adapted the technique to potatoes. American soldiers stationed in French-speaking Belgium during World War I popularized the term "French" fries, referring to the method of slicing potatoes into thin strips, which is known as "frenching." Over time, French fries have evolved into a staple of fast food culture, with numerous variations such as shoestring fries, steak fries, curly fries, crinkle-cut fries, and waffle fries, each offering a different texture and flavor profile. In Belgium, fries, known as "frites," are typically cut thicker and fried twice to achieve an extra crispy texture. They are often served with a variety of dipping sauces, including mayonnaise, which is particularly popular in Belgium and the Netherlands, while ketchup remains the most common pairing in the United States.
The process of making French fries involves selecting the right type of potato, usually starchy varieties like Russet potatoes, which have a low moisture content, making them ideal for achieving a crisp texture when fried. After peeling and cutting the potatoes into strips, many recipes suggest soaking the cut potatoes in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch, which helps prevent them from sticking together and enhances their crispiness during frying. The double-frying method is commonly used to ensure that the fries are cooked thoroughly and achieve the desired crispy exterior. In this method, the potatoes are first fried at a lower temperature to cook them through, then removed from the oil and allowed to cool before being fried again at a higher temperature to crisp up the outside. This method is key to creating the perfect French fry, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. After frying, the fries are drained of excess oil and seasoned immediately, with salt being the most common seasoning, though other flavors such as garlic, herbs, and cheese can be added to enhance their taste.
In addition to traditional French fries, there are numerous variations and adaptations to suit different tastes and dietary preferences. For example, sweet potato fries are a popular alternative, offering a slightly sweeter flavor and additional nutritional benefits, as sweet potatoes are higher in fiber and vitamins compared to regular potatoes. For those seeking healthier options, French fries can be baked or air-fried, both of which significantly reduce the amount of oil used while still providing a crispy texture. Baked fries are tossed in olive oil and seasoned before being spread in a single layer on a baking sheet and cooked at a high temperature. Air-frying has become increasingly popular as a method that uses hot air circulation to replicate the crispiness of deep-frying with far less oil. In terms of dietary adaptations, French fries are naturally vegan and gluten-free, provided that they are cooked in oil that is not shared with gluten-containing foods. Many restaurants and home cooks have also embraced the use of healthier oils such as olive or avocado oil, which contain beneficial fats and contribute to a healthier overall profile.
French fries are not only popular on their own but are also the foundation of many beloved dishes around the world. One such dish is chili cheese fries, where fries are topped with hearty chili and melted cheese, creating a rich and indulgent treat. Another famous dish is poutine, a Canadian specialty from Quebec, consisting of French fries topped with cheese curds and smothered in gravy. This dish has become a national favorite in Canada and is now enjoyed internationally. Despite their status as a comfort food, French fries are often criticized for their high calorie and fat content due to the deep-frying process. A typical serving of French fries contains around 250-300 calories, depending on the size of the portion and the type of oil used. While they provide some vitamins and minerals, such as potassium and vitamin C, especially when made from unpeeled potatoes, the nutritional benefits are often outweighed by the high fat content and the risk of overconsumption leading to health issues such as obesity and heart disease. However, when enjoyed in moderation and prepared with healthier cooking methods, French fries can be a delicious and relatively nutritious treat.
In addition to their widespread popularity, French fries hold cultural significance in many regions. In the United States, they are a staple of fast food, often served alongside burgers, sandwiches, and fried chicken. In Belgium and the Netherlands, French fries are considered a national dish and are commonly served in paper cones with a variety of sauces, including mayonnaise, curry ketchup, and tartar sauce. French fries are also celebrated with their own holiday, National French Fry Day, which is observed on July 13 in the United States, providing an opportunity for people to indulge in their favorite type of fries. The versatility of French fries extends beyond their form and preparation; they are enjoyed by people of all ages and can be found in high-end restaurants as well as casual dining establishments. Globally, French fries are known by different names, such as "frites" in French, "papas fritas" in Spanish, and "pommes frites" in German. The influence of fast food chains like McDonald's has played a significant role in the global spread of French fries, making them one of the most recognizable and accessible foods around the world.
The love for French fries has also led to innovation in how they are prepared and served. From loaded fries topped with bacon, cheese, and jalapeños, to gourmet versions tossed in truffle oil and Parmesan, French fries continue to evolve as chefs and home cooks experiment with new flavors and combinations. Additionally, the science behind making perfect French fries has been extensively studied. Achieving the right balance of texture and flavor involves understanding the Maillard reaction, a chemical process that occurs when the potatoes are fried, giving them their characteristic golden-brown color and rich, complex flavor. The optimal frying temperature is key to ensuring that the outside becomes crispy while the inside remains soft and tender. Frying at too high a temperature can cause the exterior to brown too quickly, leaving the interior undercooked, while frying at too low a temperature can result in soggy fries.
In conclusion, French fries are much more than just a side dish; they are a culinary icon that has transcended borders and become a favorite food for people around the world. Whether enjoyed with ketchup, mayonnaise, or a more exotic sauce, French fries offer endless possibilities for customization and enjoyment. Their rich history, diverse preparation methods, and global appeal make them a fascinating subject in the world of food, and their ability to bring joy and satisfaction to millions is a testament to their enduring popularity.
French fries, also known simply as fries, are one of the most popular side dishes and snacks worldwide. They are typically made by cutting potatoes into thin strips or slices, frying them in hot oil until golden and crispy, and then seasoning them with salt. The result is a delicious, crispy exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. French fries are often served as a side to burgers, sandwiches, or fried chicken, but they are also eaten on their own as a snack or even as a meal when loaded with toppings. The simplicity of French fries — potatoes, oil, and salt — is what makes them so beloved, but the different preparation methods and toppings around the world add unique flavors and textures to this universal dish.
The basic French fry is made from potatoes, typically starchy varieties like Russets, which are preferred for their lower moisture content. This helps create a crispy fry because the moisture in waxy potatoes can prevent them from browning properly. The oil used for frying also plays an important role, with vegetable oil, peanut oil, and sunflower oil being the most commonly used due to their neutral flavors and high smoke points. Once the potatoes are cut, they are often soaked in cold water to remove excess starch, which helps achieve a crispier fry. After frying, salt is almost always sprinkled on the fries to enhance their flavor, though other seasonings like pepper, garlic powder, or herbs are also common. The combination of crispy, salty fries with their contrasting soft interior is what makes them an irresistible food for many people across the globe.
Although French fries are most commonly associated with fast food and casual dining, they have made their way into all kinds of cuisine. They can be found in everything from fine dining restaurants, where they might be served alongside steak or duck, to street food vendors in cities worldwide. In some cultures, French fries are a staple of street food, often served in paper cones with a variety of sauces for dipping. The versatility of French fries means that they can be dressed up or down to suit any occasion, whether you're grabbing a quick snack on the go or enjoying a gourmet meal at a high-end restaurant.
French fries have also become an iconic part of fast food culture, particularly in countries like the United States, where they are a standard offering at most fast-food chains. Companies like McDonald's and Burger King have helped solidify the status of French fries as a beloved side dish. In fact, McDonald’s French fries are so popular that they have their own distinct flavor and texture, achieved through a special frying process that includes frying the potatoes twice: once to cook them and once to crisp them. The global popularity of fast food has played a significant role in the spread of French fries as a worldwide food favorite.
The history of French fries is steeped in controversy, with both Belgium and France claiming to be the originators of the dish. The debate over where French fries were first created continues, but many food historians agree that they likely originated in Belgium, where villagers in the late 17th century began frying small fish and, when the rivers froze in the winter, started frying slices of potatoes instead. This practice became a staple in the region, where these early fries were served as a side dish or snack. Belgium’s claim is supported by the fact that fried potatoes, or "frites," are still a significant part of Belgian cuisine, where they are typically served with mayonnaise or a variety of other dipping sauces.
In France, however, fried potatoes gained popularity in the late 18th century, particularly in Paris. Some historians suggest that street vendors along the Pont Neuf, a famous bridge in Paris, sold fried potatoes as early as the late 1700s. These vendors helped spread the popularity of French fries, particularly during the French Revolution, when potatoes became a staple food due to their affordability and versatility. It is from these French vendors that the dish likely received its association with France, hence the name "French fries." However, it’s worth noting that the term "French" does not necessarily refer to the country of origin but rather the method of preparation — "frenching" refers to cutting food into thin strips, which is how the potatoes are prepared before frying.
The spread of French fries across the world, particularly to the United States, occurred largely because of World War I. American soldiers stationed in Belgium encountered fries, referred to as "frites" by the locals. Since the soldiers were in the French-speaking part of Belgium, they began calling them "French" fries, and the name stuck. Upon returning to the U.S., these soldiers helped popularize the dish, which soon became a favorite in diners and restaurants across the country. The fast-food boom in the mid-20th century, particularly with the rise of chains like McDonald’s and Burger King, cemented French fries as an essential part of American cuisine. Today, French fries are enjoyed worldwide in various forms and preparations, but their origins remain a subject of friendly culinary debate between Belgium and France.
In many cultures, French fries have become more than just a food item; they are a part of culinary identity. Belgium, in particular, has taken great pride in its "frites" culture, where they are often served in paper cones with a variety of sauces. Belgian frites are typically thicker than the fries found in most other countries, and they are fried twice to achieve a crispy outside and a soft, fluffy inside. This method of double frying has become a standard for achieving the best texture in French fries. In Belgium, there are even special shops called "fritkots" dedicated entirely to making and selling fries, and they are often paired with mussels, grilled meats, or other traditional Belgian foods. France, too, has incorporated fries into many of its classic dishes, including "steak frites," a simple but beloved dish of steak served with a generous portion of fries. The history and cultural significance of French fries in both countries reflect their deep roots in European cuisine, even as the dish has evolved and spread globally.
French fries come in many shapes and sizes, each offering a unique texture and flavor profile that caters to different tastes and preferences. The standard French fry, found in most fast food restaurants, is thin and straight-cut, offering a balance between a crispy exterior and a soft interior. These fries are the most common and are typically made from starchy potatoes like Russets, which hold up well to frying and produce a light, fluffy interior.
One of the most popular variations of the standard fry is the shoestring fry, which is much thinner and crispier. Shoestring fries are often associated with fast food chains and casual dining establishments because they cook quickly and provide an extra crunch. Due to their thinness, shoestring fries are usually crispier than thicker fries, making them a favorite for those who enjoy a crunchy texture with less of the soft potato interior.
In contrast, steak fries are much thicker and have a softer, more potato-heavy interior. Steak fries are often served with, as the name suggests, steak or other hearty dishes, where their thicker cut allows them to absorb sauces and flavors more easily. Because of their size, steak fries have a softer, almost mashed potato-like interior, which contrasts with their slightly crispy exterior.
Curly fries are another popular variation, known for their spiral shape and crispy texture. Curly fries are often seasoned with a variety of spices, such as paprika, garlic powder, or cayenne pepper, which gives them a distinctive flavor. These fries are typically fried until very crispy, making them a favorite among those who prefer a more flavorful and textured fry.
Waffle fries are another distinct variety, known for their crisscross pattern, which provides a larger surface area for crispiness. Waffle fries are often thicker than other types of fries, giving them a balance of crunch and soft interior. Their unique shape makes them ideal for holding sauces or dips, making them a popular choice in fast food chains and casual restaurants.
Crinkle-cut fries are recognizable by their wavy surface, which gives them a unique texture. These fries are often thicker than standard fries, which allows them to hold more ketchup or dipping sauce. Crinkle-cut fries are commonly found in school cafeterias or at fast food chains and are beloved for their slightly crispy, slightly chewy texture.
One of the most beloved variations of French fries is Belgian fries, or "frites." These fries are typically thicker than the standard fry and are fried twice to achieve a crispy exterior and soft, fluffy interior. The double-frying method is what sets Belgian fries apart from other types of fries, as it ensures a perfect balance between texture and flavor. Belgian fries are often served in paper cones with a variety of dipping sauces, the most popular being mayonnaise. In Belgium, these fries are considered a national treasure, and "fritkots," or fry shops, can be found on almost every street corner.
Another popular alternative to traditional fries is sweet potato fries, which have become increasingly popular in recent years as a healthier or sweeter alternative to regular French fries. Sweet potato fries are made from sweet potatoes, which have a naturally sweeter flavor and provide more vitamins and nutrients than regular potatoes. These fries are often served in health-conscious restaurants or as a side dish in gourmet burger joints, where they can be paired with spicy or tangy dipping sauces to complement their sweetness.
Regional differences in French fry preparation and serving also add to the variety of options available. In the United States, French fries are most commonly served with ketchup, while in Belgium and the Netherlands, mayonnaise is the preferred dipping sauce. In the UK, French fries, often referred to as "chips," are typically served with malt vinegar, particularly when paired with fish in the classic dish of fish and chips. In Canada, poutine, a dish consisting of French fries topped with cheese curds and gravy, has become a national comfort food. Each region's take on French fries adds a unique twist to this simple yet beloved food, ensuring that there is a style of fry to suit every taste.
French fries are made from a few simple ingredients, but the quality and type of ingredients used can have a significant impact on the flavor, texture, and nutritional content of the final product. The primary ingredient, of course, is the potato. Starchy potatoes like Russet potatoes are preferred for making French fries because their high starch content and low moisture levels create a crispy fry that holds up well during frying. Potatoes are naturally a good source of vitamins and minerals, particularly potassium and vitamin C, and when left unpeeled, they can also provide dietary fiber. However, the frying process can diminish some of the nutritional benefits, especially when the fries are peeled, as much of the fiber and nutrients are concentrated in the potato skin.
The oil used for frying is another important factor in the quality of French fries. Vegetable oil, canola oil, peanut oil, and sunflower oil are among the most common oils used for frying because they have neutral flavors and high smoke points, meaning they can be heated to high temperatures without burning. The type of oil used can affect both the flavor and the nutritional content of the fries. For example, peanut oil tends to lend a slightly nutty flavor, while vegetable oil offers a more neutral taste. In terms of health, some oils, like olive oil and avocado oil, are considered healthier because they contain higher levels of monounsaturated fats, which are beneficial for heart health. However, these oils are not typically used for deep frying due to their lower smoke points and stronger flavors.
Salt is the most common seasoning used on French fries, and it plays a crucial role in enhancing the flavor of the fries. After frying, salt is usually sprinkled over the hot fries to ensure it adheres to the surface. While salt is essential for flavor, consuming too much sodium can lead to health issues like high blood pressure, so it's important to season fries in moderation. Some people prefer to add other seasonings to their fries, such as garlic powder, paprika, or herbs like rosemary or thyme, which can add complexity to the flavor without the need for excessive salt.
In terms of nutrition, French fries are considered a high-calorie, high-fat food due to the deep-frying process. A typical serving of French fries (about 100 grams) contains roughly 250-300 calories, depending on the size of the fry and the type of oil used. Most of the calories come from the fat absorbed during frying, with additional calories coming from the carbohydrates in the potatoes. French fries are also relatively high in fat, particularly when fried in oils that are high in saturated fats. While French fries can provide some vitamins and minerals, such as potassium and vitamin C, the frying process reduces the overall nutritional value of the potatoes, particularly when the fries are peeled, as much of the fiber is lost along with the skin.
Despite their high calorie and fat content, French fries can be part of a balanced diet when eaten in moderation. They are often enjoyed as a side dish, and many people balance their meals by pairing fries with protein-rich foods like burgers or grilled chicken. However, regular consumption of deep-fried foods like French fries can contribute to health issues such as obesity, heart disease, and high cholesterol, particularly when eaten in large quantities or as part of a diet high in processed foods and saturated fats. For those looking to enjoy French fries while maintaining a healthier diet, baked or air-fried fries offer a lower-calorie alternative that retains much of the flavor and texture of traditional fries without the added fat from deep frying.
The process of making French fries is relatively simple, but achieving the perfect balance of crispy exterior and soft, fluffy interior requires attention to detail and the right cooking techniques. The key steps in making French fries include peeling and cutting the potatoes, soaking them to remove excess starch, frying (sometimes twice), and seasoning them properly. Each of these steps contributes to the texture, flavor, and overall quality of the fries.
The first step is choosing the right type of potato. Russet potatoes, known for their high starch content and low moisture levels, are typically the best choice for French fries because they become crispy when fried while maintaining a fluffy interior. Once the potatoes are selected, they are peeled, though some people prefer to leave the skin on for added texture and nutritional value. The potatoes are then cut into strips, with the thickness depending on the desired style of fry. For standard fries, strips are usually cut to a thickness of about ¼ inch, but for steak fries or shoestring fries, the thickness can vary significantly. The uniformity of the cut is important to ensure that all the fries cook evenly.
After cutting, the fries are often soaked in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch. This step is crucial because it helps prevent the fries from sticking together during frying and promotes a crispier texture. Soaking also helps achieve a more uniform golden-brown color when frying. Some recipes recommend soaking the fries for several hours or even overnight for maximum crispiness. After soaking, the fries should be thoroughly dried using a clean kitchen towel or paper towels to remove any excess moisture. If the fries are still wet when they are added to the hot oil, the water will cause the oil to splatter and may prevent the fries from crisping properly.
The frying process is where the magic happens. French fries can be fried in a variety of oils, but vegetable oil, canola oil, and peanut oil are common choices because they have high smoke points and neutral flavors. The oil should be heated to around 325°F to 350°F for the first fry. Many chefs and home cooks use the double-frying method, where the fries are fried twice to achieve the ideal texture. In this method, the first fry is done at a lower temperature (around 325°F), cooking the potatoes through without browning them too much. After frying for about 3-4 minutes, the fries are removed from the oil and drained on paper towels to remove excess grease. They are then allowed to cool slightly before being fried again at a higher temperature (around 375°F). The second fry is where the fries develop their crispy exterior. This step typically takes another 2-3 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fries, and the fries should be removed once they turn golden brown and crispy.
Once fried, the fries should be immediately drained on paper towels to absorb any remaining oil. At this point, seasoning is crucial. Salt is the most common seasoning used on French fries, and it should be sprinkled on while the fries are still hot to ensure it sticks. Some people prefer to add additional seasonings, such as garlic powder, paprika, or even fresh herbs like rosemary or parsley, which can give the fries extra flavor and depth. The fries are then ready to be served, either on their own or as a side to a main dish.
While deep-frying is the traditional method of cooking French fries, many people look for healthier alternatives. Baking and air-frying are popular methods that use less oil while still delivering a satisfying crispy texture. For baked fries, the potatoes are cut and soaked as usual, then tossed with a small amount of oil and any desired seasonings. The fries are spread in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and baked at a high temperature, usually around 425°F, for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through to ensure even browning. Air fryers work by circulating hot air around the food, creating a crispy exterior similar to deep-frying but with far less oil. Air-fried French fries are made by lightly coating the potato strips in oil and placing them in the air fryer basket. They are typically cooked at around 375°F for 15-20 minutes, shaking the basket occasionally to ensure even cooking.
Whichever method is used, the key to making perfect French fries is balancing the temperature and cooking time to achieve the ideal texture. Frying at too low a temperature can result in soggy fries, while frying at too high a temperature can cause the exterior to brown too quickly, leaving the interior undercooked. The double-frying method is widely considered the best way to achieve crispy fries with a soft interior, but baking and air-frying provide healthier alternatives that still deliver satisfying results.
One of the reasons French fries are so universally loved is their versatility when it comes to toppings and dipping sauces. While plain salted fries are delicious on their own, the addition of various toppings and sauces can elevate them to a whole new level. Whether you prefer classic ketchup, gourmet aioli, or indulgent cheese, there is a topping or dipping sauce to suit every palate.
Salt is the most common topping for French fries, and it enhances the natural flavor of the potato while complementing the crispiness of the fries. Some people prefer sea salt or kosher salt for a more intense, slightly coarser texture, while others opt for flavored salts like garlic salt or truffle salt for a more gourmet experience. The key to perfectly salted fries is to add the salt immediately after frying, while the fries are still hot, so that the salt adheres to the surface of the fries.
For those who want to take their fries to the next level, cheese is a popular topping that adds richness and creaminess to the dish. Cheese fries are a favorite comfort food, with melted cheddar cheese drizzled over a pile of hot fries. Some variations include nacho cheese sauce, which provides a smooth, tangy flavor, or even grated Parmesan cheese, which adds a sharp, salty taste. Chili cheese fries are a heartier option, combining French fries with chili (usually made with ground beef and beans) and melted cheese for a satisfying, indulgent dish.
Garlic and herbs are another way to add flavor to French fries without overpowering their natural taste. Garlic fries are a popular choice at restaurants and sports arenas, where the fries are tossed with minced garlic and sometimes parsley or rosemary for a fresh, aromatic flavor. The combination of crispy fries with the pungent garlic creates a savory and satisfying snack or side dish.
When it comes to dipping sauces, ketchup is by far the most popular choice, particularly in the United States. Its tangy, slightly sweet flavor pairs perfectly with the salty, crispy fries, and it has become a classic combination. In other parts of the world, however, other sauces are more common. In Belgium, mayonnaise is the preferred dip for fries, and it’s often served in generous portions alongside a cone of thick-cut, twice-fried Belgian fries. Ranch dressing is another favorite dip, particularly in the United States, where its creamy, tangy flavor complements the crispiness of the fries. Barbecue sauce is a popular choice for those who enjoy a smoky, slightly sweet flavor with their fries, while mustard provides a tangy, slightly spicy contrast to the richness of the fries.
For those who enjoy a bit of spice, Sriracha mayo or spicy aioli are excellent dipping sauces that combine the creaminess of mayonnaise with the heat of chili peppers. Aioli, a garlic-flavored mayonnaise, is a popular gourmet dip for fries, particularly in Mediterranean cuisine. Its rich, creamy texture and bold garlic flavor make it a luxurious accompaniment to a simple plate of fries. In some regions, fries are served with vinegar, particularly malt vinegar, which adds a tangy, acidic bite that cuts through the richness of the fried potatoes. This is a traditional pairing in the UK, where vinegar is often splashed over "chips" (thick-cut fries) served with fish and chips.
Other creative toppings and sauces include gravy, which is poured over fries in dishes like poutine, a Canadian specialty that combines fries, cheese curds, and gravy. Loaded fries are another indulgent option, where fries are topped with a combination of ingredients like bacon, sour cream, green onions, and melted cheese, creating a hearty, flavorful dish that can easily serve as a meal in itself.
The combination of French fries with different toppings and sauces allows for endless variations and creativity. Whether you prefer your fries plain with a sprinkle of salt or loaded with toppings and sauces, there is no wrong way to enjoy this versatile and delicious dish.
While traditional deep-fried French fries are undeniably delicious, they are also high in calories and fat, which has led many people to seek out healthier alternatives and modifications that still deliver the crispy, satisfying texture of fries without the guilt. There are several ways to make French fries healthier, from changing the cooking method to using alternative ingredients.
One of the easiest ways to make French fries healthier is by baking them instead of deep-frying. Baked fries require far less oil than their fried counterparts, significantly reducing their fat content while still achieving a crispy exterior. To make baked fries, potatoes are cut into strips, tossed in a small amount of oil, and spread in a single layer on a baking sheet. They are then baked at a high temperature (around 425°F) until golden brown and crispy. Flipping the fries halfway through the baking process ensures even browning on all sides. Baked fries can be seasoned just like traditional fries, and the result is a tasty, lower-fat alternative to deep-fried fries.
Another popular option is using an air fryer, which circulates hot air around the food to create a crispy texture similar to frying but with a fraction of the oil. Air fryers are particularly effective at making French fries because they can achieve the desired crispiness without the need for large amounts of oil. To make air-fried French fries, the potato strips are lightly coated in oil and placed in the air fryer basket, where they cook at a high temperature for about 15-20 minutes. Shaking the basket occasionally ensures even cooking, and the result is a crispy, lower-calorie fry that rivals the texture of traditional deep-fried fries.
For those looking to increase the nutritional value of their fries, sweet potato fries are a popular alternative. Sweet potatoes are naturally higher in fiber, vitamins (such as vitamin A and vitamin C), and antioxidants compared to regular potatoes, making them a healthier option. Sweet potato fries can be baked or air-fried just like regular fries, and they have a slightly sweeter flavor that pairs well with both savory and sweet toppings. Many people enjoy sweet potato fries with a sprinkle of cinnamon or a drizzle of honey for a unique twist on the classic fry.
In addition to changing the type of potato or cooking method, some people opt to use alternative oils that are considered healthier than traditional frying oils. Olive oil and avocado oil are rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, which can help lower cholesterol levels when used in moderation. While these oils have lower smoke points than some other frying oils, they can still be used for baking or air-frying French fries, adding a slightly fruity or nutty flavor to the dish.
Seasoning is another area where healthier modifications can be made. Instead of relying on salt as the primary seasoning, many people choose to season their fries with herbs and spices like garlic powder, paprika, cumin, or rosemary, which add flavor without the need for extra sodium. These seasonings can be mixed with a small amount of oil and tossed with the fries before baking or air-frying, creating a flavorful and aromatic dish.
For those following a plant-based or gluten-free diet, French fries are naturally vegan and gluten-free as long as they are made from simple ingredients like potatoes, oil, and salt. However, it's important to check that the fries are cooked in dedicated fryers that aren't used for breaded or gluten-containing foods, as cross-contamination can occur in some restaurants. Gluten-free and vegan diners can enjoy French fries with confidence, knowing that this classic dish fits into their dietary preferences without the need for modifications.
By making small adjustments to the ingredients and cooking methods, French fries can be transformed into a healthier, more nutritious dish that still delivers the crispy, satisfying texture we all love. Whether baked, air-fried, or made with sweet potatoes, these healthier versions of French fries are a great way to enjoy this beloved food without compromising on flavor.
French fries, being inherently simple with just potatoes, oil, and salt, are naturally adaptable to a wide variety of dietary needs. However, certain considerations must be made to ensure that French fries fit within specific dietary restrictions, such as vegan, gluten-free, or low-sodium diets. Fortunately, most French fries can be easily modified or are already suitable for many of these diets with minimal adjustments.
For those following a vegan or vegetarian diet, French fries are generally a safe choice, as they are usually made from just potatoes and oil. As long as the fries are not cooked in animal fat or topped with non-vegan ingredients like cheese or bacon, they can be enjoyed by vegans and vegetarians alike. However, it is important to check that the frying oil is 100% plant-based, as some restaurants or fast food chains may use animal-based fats like lard or beef tallow, which would make the fries non-vegan. Additionally, some fries may be cross-contaminated in fryers that are used for cooking animal products like fried chicken, so it's worth asking about cooking methods if strict vegan guidelines are followed.
Gluten-free diets can also accommodate French fries, as potatoes themselves are naturally gluten-free. However, the key issue here is cross-contamination. Some restaurants fry their French fries in the same oil used for breaded or battered foods, such as onion rings, chicken tenders, or mozzarella sticks, which contain gluten. This can lead to cross-contamination, making the fries unsafe for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance. As long as the fries are prepared in a dedicated gluten-free fryer or at home where cross-contamination can be controlled, they remain a gluten-free option. Additionally, some pre-packaged or frozen fries might be coated in flour or other additives, so it’s essential to read labels carefully to ensure they are truly gluten-free.
For those who are looking to reduce sodium intake due to health concerns like high blood pressure or heart disease, French fries can easily be adapted by controlling the amount of salt used during seasoning. Most restaurant or fast-food fries come heavily salted, but if you’re making fries at home, you have full control over the amount of salt used. In place of salt, many people opt to season their fries with herbs and spices, such as garlic powder, paprika, or cumin, which provide plenty of flavor without adding sodium. Additionally, using salt alternatives like potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride can reduce the sodium content while still offering a salty taste.
Low-fat diets may require a more significant adaptation, as traditional deep-fried French fries are high in fat due to the oil used for frying. However, baked or air-fried French fries are excellent alternatives that use far less oil, resulting in a much lower fat content. By lightly coating the potato strips with just a small amount of olive oil or using a cooking spray, you can significantly reduce the amount of fat while still achieving crispy, delicious fries. Air fryers, in particular, are great for making low-fat French fries, as they use hot air to create a crispy exterior with very little oil, making them a healthier option for those trying to limit fat intake.
French fries can also be adapted for people following low-carb or keto diets, although potatoes themselves are naturally high in carbohydrates, making traditional French fries unsuitable for strict low-carb diets. However, some creative alternatives include using vegetables like zucchini, turnips, or parsnips to make low-carb fries. These vegetables can be cut into fry-like strips and baked or air-fried to achieve a similar texture to potato fries but with significantly fewer carbohydrates. Celeriac, or celery root, is another popular low-carb substitute for potatoes that can be used to make fries. While these alternatives may not taste exactly like traditional French fries, they provide a satisfying and crispy option for those who need to limit their carbohydrate intake.
In terms of allergen considerations, French fries are generally safe for people with common food allergies, as potatoes are not a common allergen. However, it’s important to check for any additives or cross-contamination issues, especially in commercial or pre-packaged fries. Some frozen fries may contain preservatives, flavor enhancers, or coatings that could trigger food allergies, so always check ingredient labels if food sensitivities are a concern.
Overall, French fries are highly adaptable to a wide range of dietary needs, making them a versatile and inclusive food. With a few simple adjustments to the ingredients or preparation methods, French fries can fit into nearly any diet, from vegan to gluten-free, low-sodium, or low-fat. This adaptability is one of the many reasons why French fries remain a universally loved dish, enjoyed by people with diverse dietary preferences and restrictions.
The beauty of French fries lies in their simplicity, but they can also serve as a canvas for creativity when it comes to recipes. From classic fries to more elaborate variations like chili cheese fries or baked fries, there’s a French fry recipe for every taste. Whether you prefer the traditional deep-fried version or a healthier baked alternative, these recipes offer a range of options to suit any preference.
Classic French Fries Recipe:
This is the most basic and widely loved version of French fries, and it serves as the foundation for many other variations. For classic French fries, you'll need:

Despite their simplicity, making the perfect French fries can sometimes be tricky, and even experienced cooks may run into problems such as soggy fries, undercooked interiors, or fries that brown too quickly. Here are some of the most common questions and issues people encounter when making French fries, along with troubleshooting tips to help achieve the best results.
Why are my French fries soggy?
Soggy fries are a common issue, and they typically occur when the oil temperature is too low or when the fries are too wet before frying. If the oil is not hot enough, the fries will absorb too much oil before they have a chance to crisp up. To prevent this, make sure the oil is heated to the correct temperature (around 350°F to 375°F) before adding the fries. Using a deep-frying thermometer can help ensure the oil is at the right temperature. Additionally, it’s important to dry the potatoes thoroughly after soaking them in water. Excess moisture on the surface of the fries can cause them to steam instead of fry, leading to sogginess.
Another solution is to use the double-frying method, where the fries are first fried at a lower temperature to cook them through and then fried a second time at a higher temperature to achieve a crispy exterior. This method helps ensure that the fries are fully cooked and crispy without becoming greasy or soggy.
Why do my fries turn brown before cooking through?
If your fries are turning brown too quickly before they are fully cooked on the inside, it likely means that the oil is too hot. When the oil temperature is too high, the exterior of the fries will brown rapidly, leaving the interior undercooked and hard. To avoid this, make sure the oil is at the correct temperature before frying. For the first fry (if using the double-frying method), the oil should be around 325°F, which allows the fries to cook through without browning too much. For the second fry, the temperature can be increased to 375°F, which gives the fries their golden-brown color and crispy texture.
Why do you soak potatoes before frying?
Soaking the potatoes in cold water before frying is an important step for achieving crispy fries. Soaking helps remove excess starch from the surface of the potatoes, which can cause the fries to stick together and prevents them from becoming crispy. Soaking also helps the potatoes cook more evenly and prevents the exterior from browning too quickly. For best results, soak the cut potatoes in cold water for at least 30 minutes, though soaking them for several hours or overnight will yield even better results.
Can French fries be frozen?
Yes, French fries can be frozen and reheated later. To freeze French fries, follow these steps:
Prepare the Fries: Cut the potatoes and soak them in cold water, then dry them thoroughly.
Par-cook the Fries: Fry the potatoes at a lower temperature (around 325°F) for about 3-4 minutes. The fries should be cooked through but not browned. Remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels.
Freeze: Spread the fries in a single layer on a baking sheet and place them in the freezer until fully frozen, about 1-2 hours. Once frozen, transfer the fries to a freezer-safe bag or container.
Reheat: When ready to serve, fry the frozen fries in hot oil (375°F) for 2-3 minutes until golden and crispy. Alternatively, you can bake or air-fry the frozen fries until they are heated through and crispy.
Freezing par-cooked fries is a great way to save time and have homemade fries ready whenever you want them.
By troubleshooting these common issues and following the right techniques, you can ensure that your French fries come out perfectly crispy and delicious every time.
French fries, despite their simplicity, hold a significant place in the culinary traditions and popular culture of many countries around the world. While often seen as a casual snack or side dish, their widespread popularity has turned French fries into a symbol of fast food, comfort, and indulgence in many regions. The cultural importance of French fries extends beyond just eating them — they have been celebrated in festivals, memorialized in art, and even turned into national dishes.
In Belgium, French fries (or frites, as they are called) are an integral part of the country’s culinary identity. In Belgium, frites are traditionally served in fritkots — small roadside stands dedicated solely to selling fries, usually served in a paper cone with a generous amount of mayonnaise or other sauces. Belgian fries are known for being thicker than most other varieties and are typically double-fried to achieve a perfect balance between a crispy outside and a fluffy interior. Belgian frites are often paired with moules frites (mussels and fries), a classic dish that’s popular in the country’s coastal regions. Belgians take great pride in their fries, and the debate over whether Belgium or France invented French fries is a source of friendly rivalry between the two nations.
In France, French fries are also a beloved side dish, particularly when served with steak frites, a simple yet iconic combination of grilled steak and crispy fries. Though the French term "frites" refers to fries in general, the dish of steak frites has become a hallmark of French bistros and casual dining. French fries are commonly served with aioli (a garlic-flavored mayonnaise) in many parts of southern France, where the creamy, rich sauce adds an extra layer of indulgence to the crispy fries.
The popularity of French fries is perhaps most apparent in the United States, where they have become an essential part of American fast food culture. French fries are a staple at fast food chains like McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s, and are often served alongside hamburgers, hot dogs, and fried chicken. In fact, McDonald’s fries have become so iconic that they have a distinct flavor and texture due to the company’s unique preparation process, which includes blanching the potatoes and frying them twice. French fries are so beloved in the U.S. that they even have their own national holiday — National French Fry Day, celebrated on July 13th. On this day, many fast food chains and restaurants offer special promotions, discounts, or free fries to celebrate the occasion. French fries are not only a comfort food but also a symbol of American fast food culture, representing both convenience and indulgence.
In Canada, French fries take on a unique cultural significance in the form of poutine, a dish that originated in Quebec but has since become a national favorite. Poutine consists of French fries topped with fresh cheese curds and smothered in hot gravy, creating a rich, hearty, and comforting dish. The origins of poutine date back to the 1950s in rural Quebec, and the dish quickly gained popularity across the country. Today, poutine is a staple in Canadian diners, fast food chains, and even high-end restaurants, where chefs have created gourmet versions with ingredients like foie gras, pulled pork, and truffle oil. Poutine has become so popular that it is now celebrated at poutine festivals in cities like Montreal and Toronto, where vendors showcase creative variations on the classic dish.
In the United Kingdom, French fries (known as chips in British English) are an essential component of the iconic dish fish and chips, which has been a national favorite since the 19th century. Fish and chips are traditionally served with malt vinegar, a tangy condiment that complements the crispy fries and battered fish. The dish is often associated with seaside towns and British pub culture, where it is enjoyed by both locals and tourists alike. Fish and chips have become such a cultural symbol in the UK that there are numerous fish and chip shops (or "chippies") across the country, each with its own loyal customer base.
The influence of French fries extends beyond these countries, as they have become a global phenomenon. In the Netherlands, French fries are often served with fritessaus, a slightly sweeter, lighter version of mayonnaise. In Germany, fries are commonly paired with currywurst — a popular street food consisting of sliced sausage topped with curry-flavored ketchup, often served with a side of fries. In many Middle Eastern countries, fries are stuffed inside pita bread sandwiches like shawarma and falafel wraps, adding a crispy texture to the dish. French fries have even found their way into more unusual combinations, such as being served with ice cream or dipped in milkshakes at some American fast-food chains.
The cultural significance of French fries is also reflected in the way they are celebrated in various festivals and events. Fry festivals, like the one held in Brussels, Belgium, are dedicated entirely to the celebration of French fries, where vendors from all over the country showcase their unique fry-making techniques and serve up countless variations of the dish. In France, towns like Sarlat host La Fête de la Truffe, where gourmet fries are made with truffle oil, pairing French fries with one of France’s most prized ingredients.
French fries, in their various forms, are not just a food but a part of the cultural fabric of many countries. Their simple ingredients and widespread appeal have made them a beloved dish across the globe, celebrated in festivals, holidays, and regional variations that reflect the unique culinary traditions of each culture.
As with many popular foods, the environmental impact of producing and consuming French fries is an important consideration, particularly as the global demand for fast food and convenience foods continues to grow. The production of French fries involves several factors that contribute to their environmental footprint, from the farming of potatoes to the energy used in frying and packaging. However, there are also ways to make the production and consumption of French fries more sustainable by focusing on eco-friendly practices, waste reduction, and responsible sourcing.
The primary ingredient in French fries — potatoes — is a relatively sustainable crop compared to other staple foods like wheat, rice, or corn. Potatoes are generally considered an efficient crop because they require less water to grow than many other plants and produce a high yield per acre. Additionally, potatoes grow in a wide range of climates and soil types, making them adaptable to various farming environments. However, large-scale industrial potato farming, which supplies many fast food chains and processed food manufacturers, can have a significant environmental impact if not managed responsibly. Industrial potato farming often relies on monoculture practices, which can deplete soil nutrients, lead to increased pesticide use, and contribute to habitat loss and biodiversity decline.
One of the main environmental concerns associated with French fries is the use of oil for frying. The production and disposal of frying oil can have a considerable ecological impact, particularly when it comes to sourcing and managing waste. Palm oil, for example, is commonly used in the production of French fries because of its high smoke point and low cost, but palm oil production has been linked to deforestation and habitat destruction in tropical regions like Southeast Asia. To mitigate this, many companies have started to source sustainable palm oil, certified by organizations like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), which promotes responsible farming practices that minimize environmental harm. Alternatively, some restaurants and manufacturers have switched to using oils like sunflower oil, canola oil, or avocado oil, which have lower environmental impacts.
Another environmental consideration is the energy consumption involved in the preparation of French fries. Frying requires a significant amount of energy to heat large quantities of oil to the high temperatures needed for frying. In commercial settings, fryers are often left running for extended periods, leading to high energy use. Some restaurants and manufacturers have adopted energy-efficient frying equipment that reduces energy consumption and improves overall sustainability. Additionally, the use of air fryers for making French fries at home has gained popularity as a more eco-friendly alternative to deep frying. Air fryers use hot air circulation to cook food with less energy and minimal oil, reducing both the carbon footprint and waste associated with traditional frying methods.
Food waste is another important factor when considering the environmental impact of French fries. In both commercial and household settings, French fries are often overproduced, leading to significant food waste. Additionally, many French fries are discarded because they are not served at optimal freshness, especially in fast food settings where fries may sit under heat lamps for extended periods. Reducing food waste can be achieved by implementing better portion control, reducing overproduction, and finding creative ways to repurpose leftover fries. Some restaurants have also started offering smaller portion sizes to cut down on waste.
Packaging is yet another concern in the sustainability of French fries. Fast food chains often serve fries in disposable containers, contributing to plastic and paper waste. To combat this, many companies have begun adopting eco-friendly packaging made from recyclable or biodegradable materials. Some businesses have switched to compostable containers and recyclable paper cones or boxes, which help reduce the environmental impact of single-use packaging. In regions with strong recycling and composting infrastructure, this shift can have a significant positive effect on reducing waste.
One innovative approach to making French fries more sustainable is the concept of locally sourced fries. By sourcing potatoes from local farms, restaurants can reduce the carbon footprint associated with transporting produce over long distances. Supporting local agriculture also promotes sustainable farming practices and helps boost local economies. In some regions, farm-to-table restaurants offer French fries made from locally grown, organic potatoes, cooked in responsibly sourced oil, and served in eco-friendly packaging. These efforts help create a more sustainable food system by reducing the overall environmental impact of the dish.
Furthermore, there are growing initiatives to recycle used frying oil. In many regions, used cooking oil is collected and repurposed into biodiesel, a renewable energy source that can be used in vehicles and machinery. Recycling cooking oil not only reduces waste but also provides a sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Restaurants and food manufacturers that participate in oil recycling programs contribute to reducing their carbon footprint and promoting the use of renewable energy.
In conclusion, while French fries have an environmental footprint, there are many ways to make their production and consumption more sustainable. By sourcing ingredients responsibly, reducing energy consumption, minimizing food waste, using eco-friendly packaging, and recycling cooking oil, both individuals and businesses can enjoy French fries in a more environmentally conscious way. As awareness of sustainability continues to grow, many companies and consumers are adopting greener practices to ensure that French fries remain an enjoyable and environmentally responsible food choice.
The process of making the perfect French fry is not just about following a recipe — it’s also about understanding the science behind how potatoes cook and why certain techniques produce better results than others. From the Maillard reaction that gives fries their golden-brown color to the double-frying method that creates a crispy exterior and fluffy interior, there are many scientific principles at work when making French fries.
One of the most important factors in creating great French fries is the type of potato used. Starchy potatoes, such as Russet potatoes, are ideal for French fries because they have a high starch content and low moisture levels. The starch in potatoes plays a critical role in how they cook. When fries are fried, the heat causes the starch granules in the potato to absorb water and swell, which helps create a soft, fluffy interior. At the same time, the surface of the potato dries out and forms a crispy crust. Waxy potatoes, on the other hand, contain more moisture and less starch, which can lead to soggier fries because they don’t develop the same crispy exterior.
Another key scientific process involved in making French fries is the Maillard reaction, a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that occurs when food is heated at high temperatures. The Maillard reaction is responsible for the browning and flavor development of many cooked foods, including French fries. When potatoes are fried, the high heat causes the sugars and proteins in the potato to react, forming new flavor compounds and creating the characteristic golden-brown color of a perfectly fried fry. The Maillard reaction is essential for achieving the right flavor and appearance in French fries, and it is more pronounced at higher temperatures, which is why the second fry in the double-frying method is done at a higher temperature.
Speaking of double-frying, this technique is one of the most widely used methods for achieving perfectly crispy fries. The double-frying method involves frying the potatoes twice: first at a lower temperature to cook the potato through, and then at a higher temperature to crisp up the exterior. The first fry, usually done at around 325°F, allows the potatoes to soften and cook internally without browning too much. This step ensures that the fries are fully cooked on the inside. After the first fry, the fries are typically drained and allowed to cool, which helps remove excess moisture. The second fry, done at a higher temperature of around 375°F, is where the magic happens. During this fry, the surface of the fries becomes crispy and golden brown, thanks to the Maillard reaction. The result is a fry that is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.
Another advanced technique that can improve the texture and flavor of French fries is soaking the potatoes in water before frying. Soaking helps remove excess starch from the surface of the potatoes, which can prevent the fries from sticking together during frying and helps achieve a crispier texture. Soaking also allows the potatoes to release some of their moisture, which can reduce the risk of steam forming inside the fry during cooking, leading to a soggier texture. Some chefs recommend soaking the potatoes for several hours or even overnight for the best results. After soaking, it’s important to thoroughly dry the potatoes before frying to avoid splattering oil and ensure even cooking.
For those who want to delve even deeper into the science of French fries, it’s worth exploring the pH levels of the frying oil. The acidity of the oil can affect the texture of the fries. Low-acid oils tend to produce crispier fries because they encourage more water evaporation from the surface of the fries. Some chefs add a small amount of vinegar or lemon juice to the water when soaking the potatoes, which can help balance the pH and improve the final texture of the fries.
Air fryers, while relatively new to the cooking scene, represent an advanced technique for making healthier French fries. Air frying uses hot air circulation to cook the fries, mimicking the effects of deep-frying but with far less oil. The rapid circulation of hot air around the fries allows the exterior to become crispy while the inside remains soft, similar to traditional frying methods. Air frying is especially popular for home cooks looking to reduce their oil consumption without sacrificing the crispy texture of fried foods. While air-fried fries may not achieve the exact same level of crispiness as deep-fried fries, they offer a healthier alternative that still delivers a satisfying crunch.
In conclusion, the science behind making the perfect French fry involves understanding the role of starch, the Maillard reaction, and proper frying techniques. Whether using the double-frying method, experimenting with air fryers, or soaking potatoes to remove excess starch, these advanced techniques allow for better texture, flavor, and overall enjoyment of French fries.
French fries are not only a beloved snack on their own, but they also serve as the base for many popular and indulgent dishes. From loaded fries to regional specialties, French fries have been adapted and combined with various ingredients to create iconic dishes around the world. These dishes often transform a simple serving of fries into a full meal, with toppings like cheese, chili, gravy, and more.
One of the most well-known French fry dishes is poutine, a Canadian specialty that originated in Quebec but has since gained popularity across the country and beyond. Poutine consists of French fries topped with fresh cheese curds and smothered in hot gravy, creating a rich, savory, and satisfying dish. The combination of crispy fries with the melty cheese curds and savory gravy makes poutine a beloved comfort food, particularly in the colder months. While traditional poutine is made with simple cheese curds and brown gravy, many restaurants and food trucks offer gourmet versions with toppings like pulled pork, foie gras, or truffle oil.
In the United States, one of the most popular French fry dishes is chili cheese fries, a hearty and indulgent meal that combines fries with chili (usually made with ground beef, beans, and spices) and melted cheese. Chili cheese fries are a favorite at diners, sports events, and fast food restaurants, where the combination of crispy fries, savory chili, and gooey cheese creates a satisfying and filling dish. Some variations of chili cheese fries include additional toppings like sour cream, jalapeños, or green onions, adding even more flavor and texture to the dish.
Another popular French fry dish is loaded fries, which can take on many forms depending on the region and the ingredients used. Loaded fries typically involve piling toppings like bacon, cheese, sour cream, chives, and ranch dressing on top of a plate of hot fries. These fries are often served as an appetizer or a shared dish at restaurants and bars, where they are enjoyed as a decadent, shareable snack. Loaded fries are highly customizable, and diners can add or substitute ingredients based on their preferences, making them a versatile dish.
In Europe, French fries are often paired with local specialties to create unique dishes. In Belgium, for example, French fries are commonly served with mussels in the classic dish moules-frites. This dish features a generous portion of fries served alongside steamed mussels, usually in a garlic and white wine broth. The fries are often dipped in the broth or eaten with a dollop of mayonnaise, adding a rich, creamy element to the dish.
In the United Kingdom, fish and chips is an iconic dish that pairs thick-cut fries (known as "chips" in British English) with battered and fried fish, typically cod or haddock. Fish and chips are traditionally served with malt vinegar, which adds a tangy contrast to the richness of the fried fish and potatoes. The dish is a staple of British cuisine and is often enjoyed at seaside towns or in pubs across the country.
French fries have even found their way into more unexpected dishes, such as being served as a topping for pizza or stuffed inside sandwiches. In some regions of the Middle East, French fries are added to shawarma wraps or falafel sandwiches, where they add a crispy texture to the soft, pita-wrapped fillings. In the United States, some fast food restaurants serve French fries inside burgers or as a side to pizza, creating a unique fusion of flavors.
One more international favorite is patatas bravas, a Spanish dish that features fried potatoes served with a spicy tomato sauce and aioli. While not identical to traditional French fries, patatas bravas share a similar texture and preparation method, making them a popular tapas dish in Spain. The combination of crispy potatoes with the bold, spicy sauce makes patatas bravas a favorite among those who enjoy a bit of heat with their fries.
These dishes demonstrate the versatility of French fries as a base for creating indulgent, flavorful meals. Whether enjoyed with cheese curds and gravy in poutine, chili and cheese in chili cheese fries, or alongside mussels in moules-frites, French fries serve as the foundation for many beloved dishes around the world.

Ultimately, French fries are a food that brings people together, whether at fast food restaurants, family dinners, or festive gatherings. Their universal appeal, combined with their ability to be customized to suit any palate or dietary preference, ensures that French fries will remain a beloved dish for generations to come.
French fries
French fries (North American English & British English), chips (British and other national varieties),[1] finger chips (Indian English),[2]french-fried potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet or julienne cut[3] deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium or France. They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven; air fryers are small convection ovens marketed for frying potatoes.
French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. They are often salted and may be served with

dishes of poutine, loaded fries or chili cheese fries. French fries can be made from sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. A baked variant, oven fries, uses less or no oil.[4]
Preparation
The standard method for cooking french fries is deep frying, which submerges them in hot fat, nowadays most commonly oil.[5] Vacuum fryers produce potato chips with lower oil content, while maintaining their colour and texture.[6]
The potatoes are prepared by first cutting them (peeled or unpeeled) into even strips, which are then wiped off or soaked in cold water to remove the surface starch, and thoroughly dried.[7][8] They may then be fried in

one or two stages. Chefs generally agree that the two-bath technique produces better results.[7][9][10] Potatoes fresh out of the ground can have too high a water content resulting in soggy fries, so preference is for those that have been stored for a while.[11]
In the two-stage or two-bath method, the first bath, sometimes called blanching, is in hot fat (around 160 °C/320 °F) to cook the fries through. This step can be done in advance.[7] Then they are more briefly fried in very hot fat (190 °C/375 °F) to crisp the exterior. They are then placed in a colander or on a cloth to drain, then served. The exact times of the two baths depend on the size of the fries. For example, for 2–3 mm strips, the first bath takes about 3 minutes, and the second bath takes only seconds.[7]
Since the 1960s, most french fries in the US have been produced from frozen Russet potatoes which have been blanched or at least air-dried industrially.[12][11][13][14] The usual fat for making french fries is vegetable oil. In the past, beef suet was recommended as superior,[7] with vegetable shortening as an alternative. McDonald's used a mixture of 93% beef tallow and 7% cottonseed oil until 1990, when they changed to vegetable oil with beef flavouring.[15][16] Horse fat was standard in northern France and Belgium until recently,[17] and is recommended by some chefs.[18]
Chemical and physical changes
French fries are fried in a two-step process: the first time is to

cook the starch throughout the entire cut at low heat, and the second time is to create the golden crispy exterior of the fry at a higher temperature. This is necessary because if the potato cuts are only fried once, the temperature would either be too hot, causing only the exterior to be cooked and not the inside, or not hot enough where the entire fry is cooked, but its crispy exterior will not develop. Although the potato cuts may be baked or steamed as a preparation method, this section will only focus on french fries made using frying oil. During the initial frying process (approximately 150 °C), water on the surface of the cuts evaporates off the surface and the water inside the cuts gets absorbed by the starch granules, causing them to swell and produce the fluffy interior of the fry.[19]
The starch granules are able to retain the water and expand due to gelatinisation. The water and heat break the glycosidic linkages between amylopectin and amylose strands, allowing a new gel matrix to form via hydrogen bonds which aid in water retention. The moisture that gets trapped within the gel matrix is responsible for the fluffy interior of the

fry. The gelatinised starch molecules move towards the surface of the fries "forming a thick layer of gelatinised starch" and this layer of pre-gelatinised starch becomes the crisp exterior after the potato cuts are fried for a second time.[20] During the second frying process (approximately 180 °C), the remaining
water on the surface of the cuts evaporates and the gelatinised starch molecules that collected towards the potato surface are cooked again, forming the crisp exterior. The golden-brown colour of the fry will develop when the amino acids and glucose on the exterior participate in a Maillard browning reaction.[19]

In the United States and most of Canada, the term french fries, sometimes capitalised as French fries, or shortened to fries, refers to all dishes of fried elongated pieces of potatoes. Variants in shape and size may have names such as curly fries, shoestring fries, etc.[21]
In the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Ireland and New Zealand, the term chips is generally used instead, though thinly cut fried potatoes are sometimes called french fries or skinny fries, to distinguish them from chips, which are cut thicker. In the US or Canada these more thickly-cut chips might be called steak fries, depending on the shape. The word chips is more often used in North America to refer to potato chips, commonly known in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa as crisps.[22]
Thomas Jefferson had "potatoes served in the French manner" at a White House dinner in 1802.[23][24] The expression "french fried potatoes" first occurred in print in English in the 1856 work Cookery for Maids of All Work by Eliza Warren: "French Fried Potatoes. – Cut new potatoes in thin slices, put them in boiling fat, and a little salt; fry both sides of a light golden brown colour; drain."[25] This account referred to thin, shallow-fried slices of potato. It is not clear where or when the now familiar deep-fried batons or fingers of potato were first prepared. In the early 20th century, the term "french fried" was being used in the sense of "deep-fried" for foods like onion rings or chicken.[26][27]
One story about the name "french fries" claims that when the American Expeditionary Forces arrived in Belgium during World War I, they assumed that chips were a French dish because French was spoken in the Belgian Army.[28][29] But the name existed long before that in English, and the popularity of the term did not increase for decades after 1917.[30] The term was in use in the United States as early as 1886.[31] An 1899 item in Good Housekeeping specifically references Kitchen Economy in France: "The perfection of French fries is due chiefly to the fact that plenty of fat is used."[32]
Origin
Spain
In 1673, the Chilean Francisco Núñez de Pineda mentioned eating
"papas fritas" in 1629 and women "sent fried and stewed potatoes"
to the chiefs.[33] The exact shape is unclear, likely cubes fried in
Steak frites in Fontainebleau, France
butter which was customary.[33] However, the cane shape originates from Europe.[33]
Fries may have been invented in Spain, the first European country
in which the potato appeared from the New World colonies.[34] Professor Paul Ilegems, curator of the Frietmuseum in Bruges, Belgium, believes that Saint Teresa of Ávila of Spain cooked the first french
fries, and refers also to the tradition of frying in Mediterranean cuisine as evidence.[35][36]
Belgian–French dispute
The Belgians and French have an ongoing dispute about where fries were invented.[37]
The Belgian food historian Pierre Leclercq has traced the history of the french fry and asserts that "it is clear that fries are of French origin".[38] They became an emblematic Parisian dish in the 19th century. Frédéric Krieger, a Bavarian musician, learned to cook fries at a roaster on rue Montmartre in Paris in 1842, and took the recipe to Belgium in 1844, where he created his business Fritz and sold "la pomme de terre frite à l'instar de Paris" ("Paris-style fried potatoes").[39][40] The modern style of fries born in Paris around 1855 is different from the domestic fried potato that existed in the 18th century.
From the Belgian standpoint, the popularity of the term "french
fries" is explained as "French gastronomic hegemony" into which
the cuisine of Belgium was assimilated, because of a lack of
understanding coupled with a shared language and geographic
proximity of the countries.[37] The Belgian journalist Jo Gérard
claimed that a 1781 family manuscript recounts that potatoes were
deep-fried prior to 1680 in the Meuse valley, as a substitute for
frying fish when the rivers were frozen.[29][35] Gérard never produced the manuscript that supports this claim, and "the historical value of this story is open to question".[41]In any case, it

is unrelated to the later history of the french fry, as the potato did not arrive in the region until around 1735. In any case, given 18th-century economic conditions: "it is absolutely unthinkable that a peasant could have dedicated large quantities of fat for cooking potatoes. At most they were sautéed in a pan".[42]
Global use
Netherlands
"Pommes frites" or just "frites" (French), "frieten" (a word used in Flanders and the southern provinces of the Netherlands) or "patat" (used in the north and central parts of the Netherlands) became the national snack and a substantial part of several national dishes, such as Moules-frites or Steak-frites.[43] Fries also come in the form of a common Dutch street food, known as Patatje Oorlog, translated to as "war fries". It consists of fries dressed with mayonnaise, a peanut-based satay sauce and garnished with diced raw onions along with a variety of other optional ingredients. [44]
Belgium
Fries are very popular in Belgium, where they are known as frieten (in Flemish) or frites (in Belgian French), and the Netherlands, where among the working classes they are known as patat in the north and, in the south, friet(en).[45]In Belgium, fries are sold in shops called friteries (French), frietkot/frituur (Flemish), snackbar (Dutch in The Netherlands) or Fritüre/Frittüre (German). They are served with a
large variety of Belgian sauces and eaten either on their own or with other snacks. Traditionally fries are served in a cornet de frites (French), patatzak/frietzak/fritzak (Dutch/Flemish), or Frittentüte (German), a white cardboard cone, then wrapped in paper, with a spoonful of sauce (often mayonnaise) on top.
France
In France and other French-speaking countries, fried potatoes are formally pommes de terre frites, but more commonly pommes frites, patates frites, or simply frites. The words aiguillettes ("needle-ettes") or allumettes ("matchsticks") are used when the french fries are very small and thin. One enduring origin story holds that french fries were invented by street vendors on the Pont Neuf bridge in Paris in 1789, just before the outbreak of the French Revolution.[46] However, a reference exists in France from 1775 to "a few pieces of fried potato" and to "fried potatoes".[47] Eating potatoes for sustenance was promoted in France by Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, but he did not mention fried potatoes in particular. A note in a manuscript in U.S. president Thomas Jefferson's hand (circa 1801–1809) mentions "Pommes de terre frites à cru, en petites tranches" ("Potatoes deep-fried while raw, in small slices"). The recipe almost certainly comes from his French chef, Honoré Julien.[23] The thick-cut fries are called pommes Pont Neuf[7] or simply pommes frites (about 10 mm or 3⁄8in); thinner variants are pommes allumettes (matchstick potatoes; about 7 mm or 1⁄4in), and pommes paille (potato straws; 4 mm or 1⁄8in). Pommes gaufrettes are waffle fries. A popular dish in France is steak frites, which is steak accompanied by thin french fries.
Germany
French fries migrated to the German-speaking countries during the
19th century. In Germany, they are usually known by the French
words pommes frites, or only Pommes or Fritten (derived from the
French words, but pronounced as German words).[48] Often served
with ketchup or mayonnaise, they are popular as a side dish in
restaurants, or as a street-food snack purchased at an Imbissstand
(snack stand). Since the 1950s, currywurst has become a widely
Currywurst and fries, Germany United Kingdom
popular dish that is commonly offered with fries. Currywurst is a sausage (often bratwurst or bockwurst) in a spiced ketchup-based sauce, dusted with curry powder and served with fries.[49]
The standard deep-fried cut potatoes in the United Kingdom are called chips, and are cut into pieces between 10 and 15 mm (0.39 and 0.59 in) thick. They are occasionally made from unpeeled potatoes (skins showing). British chips are not the same thing as potato chips (an American term); those are called "crisps" in the UK and some other countries. In the UK, chips are part of the popular, and now international, fast food dish fish and chips. In the UK, the name chips are a separate item to french fries; with chips being more thickly cut than french fries,
Fish and chips
they can be cooked once or multiple times at different temperatures.[50][51][52] From 1813 on, recipes for deep-fried cut potatoes occur in popular cookbooks.[53] By the late 1850s, at least one cookbook refers to "French Fried Potatoes".[54]
The first commercially available chips in the UK were sold by Mrs 'Granny' Duce in one of the West Riding towns in 1854.[55] A blue plaque in Oldham marks the origin of the fish-and-chip shop, and thus the start of the fast food industry in Britain.[56]In Scotland, chips were first sold in Dundee: "in the 1870s, that glory of British gastronomy – the chip – was first sold by Belgian immigrant Edward De Gernier in the city's Greenmarket".[57]In Ireland the first chip shop was "opened by Giuseppe Cervi", an Italian immigrant, "who arrived there in the 1880s".[58]It was estimated in 2011 that in the UK, 80% of households bought frozen chips each year.[59] Although chips were a popular dish in most Commonwealth countries, the "thin style" french fries have been popularised worldwide in large part by the large American fast food chains such as McDonald's and Burger King.[60]
United States
In the United States, the J. R. Simplot Company is credited with successfully commercialising french fries in frozen form during the 1940s. Subsequently, in 1967, Ray Kroc of McDonald's contracted the Simplot company to supply them with frozen fries, replacing fresh-cut potatoes. In 2004, 29% of the United States' potato crop was used to make frozen fries; 90% consumed by the food services sector and 10% by retail.[61] The United States supplies China with most of their french fries, as 70% of China's french fries are imported.[62][63] Pre-made french fries have been available for home cooking since the 1960s, having been pre-fried (or sometimes baked), frozen and placed in a sealed plastic bag.[64] Some fast-food chains dip the fries in a sugar solution or a starch batter, to alter the appearance or texture.[65] French fries are one of the most popular dishes in the United States, commonly being served as a side dish to main dishes and in fast food restaurants. The average American eats around 30 pounds (14 kg) of french fries a year.[66]
New Brunswick
The town of Florenceville-Bristol, New Brunswick in Canada, headquarters of McCain Foods, calls itself "the French fry capital of the world" and also hosts a museum about potatoes called Potato World.[67] McCain Foods is the world's largest manufacturer of frozen french fries and other potato specialities.[68]
Québec
French fries are the main ingredient in the Québécois dish known
as poutine, a dish consisting of fried potatoes covered with cheese
curds and brown gravy. Poutine has a growing number of
variations, but it is generally considered to have been developed in
rural Québec sometime in the 1950s, although precisely where in
the province it first appeared is a matter of contention.[69][70][71]
Canada is also responsible for providing 22% of China's french
fries.[72][63]
Spain
In Spain, fried potatoes are called patatas fritas or papas fritas. Another common form, involving larger irregular cuts, is patatas bravas. The potatoes are cut into big chunks, partially boiled and

then fried. They are usually seasoned with a spicy tomato sauce.[73] Fries are a common side dish in Latin American cuisine or part of larger preparations such as the salchipapas in Peru or chorrillana in Chile.[74][75]
South Africa
Whilst eating 'regular' crispy french fries is common in South Africa, a regional favourite, particularly in Cape Town, is a soft soggy version doused in white vinegar called "slap-chips" (pronounced "slup-chips" in English or "slaptjips" in Afrikaans).[76][77][78] These chips are typically thicker and fried at a lower temperature for a longer period of time than regular french fries.[76] Slap-chips are an important component of a Gatsby sandwich, also a common Cape Town delicacy.[76] Slap-chips are also commonly served with deep fried fish which are also served with the same white vinegar.
Japan
Fried potato (フライドポテト, Furaido poteto) is a standard fast-food side dish in Japan.[79]Inspired by Japanese cuisine, okonomiyaki fries are served with a topping of unagi sauce, mayonnaise, katsuobushi, nori seasoning (furikake) and stir-fried cabbage.[80]
Variants
French fries come in multiple variations and toppings. Some
examples include:
Carne asada fries – fries covered with carne asada,
guacamole, sour cream and cheese.[81]
Cheese fries – fries covered with cheese.[82]
Chili cheese fries – fries covered with chili and
cheese.[83]
Crinkle-cut fries – also known as "wavy fries", these are cut in a corrugated, ridged fashion.[21]
Curly fries – characterised by their helical shape, cut from whole potatoes using a specialised spiral slicer.[21] Curry chips – fries covered in curry sauce.[84]

Poutine – a dish consisting of fries topped with cheese curds and gravy and principally associated with the Canadian province of Québec.[92]
Salt and pepper chips – a British Chinese fusion dish consisting of fries tossed with stir fried vegetables.
Shoestring fries – thin-cut fries.[21]
Steak fries – thick-cut fries.[21]
Sweet potato fries – fries made with sweet potatoes instead of traditional white potatoes.[93] Tornado fries – helical-cut potatoes that are placed on a skewer and then deep fried.[21] Triple-cooked chips – fries that are simmered, cooled and drained using a low-temp-long time (LTLT) cooking technique; they are then deep fried at just 130 °C, cooled and finally deep fried at 180 °C.[94]
Waffle fries – lattice-shaped fries obtained by quarter-turning the potato before each next slide over a grater and deep-frying just once.[21]

Accompaniments
Fries tend to be served with a variety of accompaniments, such as salt and vinegar (malt, balsamic or white), pepper, Cajun seasoning, grated cheese, melted cheese, mushy peas, heated curry sauce, curry ketchup, hot sauce, relish, mustard, mayonnaise, bearnaise sauce, tartar sauce, chili, tzatziki, feta cheese,
garlic sauce, fry sauce, butter, sour cream, ranch dressing, barbecue sauce, gravy, honey, aioli, brown sauce, ketchup, lemon juice, piccalilli, pickled cucumber, pickled gherkins, pickled onions or pickled eggs.[95] In Australia, a popular flavouring added to chips is chicken salt.
Nutrition
French fries primarily contain carbohydrates (mostly in the form of starch)
and protein from the potato, and fat absorbed during the deep-frying process.
Salt, which contains sodium, is almost always applied as a surface seasoning.
For example, a large serving of french fries at McDonald's in the United
States is 154 grams and includes 350 mg of sodium. The 510 calories come
from 66 g of carbohydrates, 24 g of fat and 7 g of protein.[96]
A number of experts have criticised french fries for being very unhealthy.
According to Jonathan Bonnet in a Time magazine article, "fries are
nutritionally unrecognizable from a spud" because they "involve frying,
salting, and removing one of the healthiest parts of the potato: the skin, where
Oven-baked fries
many of the nutrients and fiber are found."[97] Kristin Kirkpatrick calls french fries "an extremely starchy vegetable dipped in a fryer that then loads on the unhealthy fat, and what you have left is a food that has no nutritional
redeeming value in it at all."[97] David Katz states that "French fries are often the super-fatty side dish to a burger—and both are often used as vehicles for things like sugar-laced ketchup and fatty mayo."[97] Eric Morrissette, spokesperson for Health Canada, states that people should limit their intake of french fries, but eating them occasionally is not likely to be a health concern.[97]
Frying french fries in beef tallow, lard, or other animal fats adds
saturated fat to them. Replacing animal fats with tropical
vegetable oils, such as palm oil, simply substitutes one saturated
fat for another. For many years partially hydrogenated vegetable
oils were used as a means of avoiding cholesterol and reducing
saturated fatty acid content, but in time the trans fat content of
these oils was perceived as contributing to cardiovascular
disease.[98] Starting in 2008, many restaurant chains and
manufacturers of pre-cooked frozen french fries for home
reheating phased out trans-fat–containing vegetable oils.[99][100] French fries contain some of the highest levels of acrylamides of
Fries frying in oil
any foodstuff, and experts have raised concerns about the effects of acrylamides on human health.[101][102] According to the American Cancer Society, it is not clear as of 2013 whether acrylamide consumption affects people's risk of getting cancer.[101] A meta-analysis indicated that dietary acrylamide is not related to the risk of most common cancers, but could not exclude a modest association for kidney, endometrial or ovarian cancers.[102] A lower-fat method for producing a french-fry–like product is to coat "frenched" or wedge potatoes in oil and spices/flavouring before baking them. The temperature will be lower compared to deep frying, which reduces acrylamide formation.[103]
In April 2023, researchers from China suggested a possible link between the consumption of fried food and mental health problems. According to the study, those who frequently consume fried food, especially potatoes, have an increased risk of depression and anxiety, by 7% and 12% respectively, compared to those who do not. The connection was particularly prominent among younger males. However, the causal relationship is not conclusive. The results are still preliminary, and the researchers are uncertain whether consuming fried foods causes mental health problems or individuals with symptoms of anxiety and depression tend to opt for fried foods.[104]
Legal issues
In June 2004, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), with the advisement of a federal district judge from Beaumont, Texas, classified batter-coated french fries as a vegetable under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. This was primarily for trade reasons; french fries do not meet the standard to be listed as a processed food.[105][106] This classification, referred to as the "French fry rule", was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit case Fleming Companies, Inc. v. USDA.[107][108]
Environmental impact
A 2022 study estimated the environmental impact of 57,000 food products in the UK and Ireland, finding that French fries have a lower impact on the environment than many other foods.[109]
